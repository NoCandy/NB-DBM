# NB-DBM

This is a DBM timer overhaul adjusted for the Sunwell-Nightbane TBC server. Including few new functions I thought would be useful.

Installation:
1. Download and install DBM for TBC 2.4.3
2. Extract and overwrite folders you want from this repo to your ..\Interface\AddOns folder.

Contents 
DBM_Outlands - High King Maulgar, Gruul the Dragonkiller and Magtheridon.
DBM_Karazhan - 11 bosses in the raid Karazan
DBM_Serpentshrine - 6 bosses in SSC
DBM_TheEye - 4 bosses in TK
