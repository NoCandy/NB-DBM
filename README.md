# NB-DBM

This is a DBM timer overhaul adjusted for the Sunwell-Nightbane TBC server. Including few new functions I thought would be useful.

Installation:
1. Have an existing working DBM for TBC 2.4.3 in ..\Interface\AddOns folder
2. Extract and overwrite folders you want from this repo to your \AddOns folder.

Contents: 

DBM_Outlands - High King Maulgar, Gruul the Dragonkiller and Magtheridon.

DBM_Karazhan - 10bosses in Karazan atm

DBM_Serpentshrine - 6 bosses in SSC

DBM_TheEye - 4 bosses in TK
